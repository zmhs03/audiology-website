			"Objective: To describe the nature of hearing loss and associated risk profile in a South African population of infants and children diagnosed at a pediatric referral clinic. Methods: A retrospective review of patient files for a pediatric auditory evoked potential clinic in Pretoria was conducted (January 2007–December 2011). Collected data included demographical information, risk factors from case history questionnaire, diagnosis (type and degree of hearing loss), documented age of caregiver suspicion and age of first diagnosis. Results: Hearing loss was present in 73% (73/100) of cases evaluated. Permanent hearing losses (SNHL, ANSD and mixed) constituted 76% of losses. Unilateral hearing losses constituted 8% of SNHL and 20% of conductive hearing loss. ANSD was diagnosed in 21.4% and SNHL in 78.6% of permanent non-conductive hearing loss cases. The most prevalent SNHL risk was family history of hearing loss and for ANSD it was admittance to the NICU for more than 5 days. The majority of the sample was diagnosed with a permanent bilateral SNHL and ANSD after 36 months of age (47%) despite 40% already suspected of having a hearing loss before 12 months of age. Conclusions: A high prevalence of ANSD was found with preventable risk factors often indicated. Age of diagnosis was significantly delayed, evidencing the lack of early hearing detection services in South Africa. The majority of children were diagnosed at ages precluding optimal benefits from early detection and subsequent intervention.",

			"The purpose of this study was to examine the current status of newborn/infant hearing screening programs in public sector hospitals in South Africa by means of a descriptive survey. Data was gathered using a self-administered postal questionnaire, which included questions on screening resources and protocols, follow-up, diagnostic, and information management procedures as well as timing of intervention. The questionnaire was sent to 86 speech therapy and audiology departments within public sector hospitals throughout South Africa and 44 questionnaires were returned. The findings indicated that 27% (n12) of respondents were conducting some form of hearing screening. The most frequently reported reasons for the absence of a screening program were a lack of appropriate equipment and a shortage of staff. Institutions with active screening programs face many challenges and programs are mostly unsystematic. Reported findings make a valuable contribution to the field of early hearing detection and intervention by providing a baseline for the development and structuring of early hearing detection and intervention services as a priority in the public healthcare sector of South Africa.

			"Objective: This study aimed to determine and describe hearing loss among preschool children in a South African community representative of typical low- and middle income countries (LMIC). Method: Children between the ages of 3-6 years received a hearing screening at their early childhood development (ECD) center. If a child failed the hearing screening, he/she was seen for a follow-up rescreen and diagnostic assessment if necessary at their ECD center or closest referral clinic. Diagnostic testing consisted of otoscopy, tympanommetry and pure-tone diagnostic audiometry. Results: A total of 6424 children were screened at ECD centers with a referral rate of 24.9%. Follow-up assessments were conducted on 45.3% (725) of these children. Diagnostic testing revealed that 9.3% of children presented with impacted cerumen and 18.7% presented with a hearing loss (56.5% binaural). Binary logistic regression revealed no gender or age effects (p > 0.05). Conductive hearing loss (65.2%) was the most common type of hearing loss found in children. Conclusions: Most preschool children who failed the hearing screening and received a diagnostic assessment were in need of intervention services for conductive hearing losses, followed by sensorineural and mixed losses.",

			"Introduction: Hypertension is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and has been associated with target organ damage. Effects of hypertension on the auditory system are varied and requires further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the association between hypertension and auditory deficits (hearing loss and tinnitus). Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional study including 106 (54.7% female) hypertensive adults aged 18–55 years, and 92 (52.2% female) non-hypertensive sex- and age-matched adults residing in South Africa. A data extraction sheet was used to obtain hypertension information from participants' medical files, and to subjectively obtain tinnitus status and characteristics among participants. Participants' hearing sensitivity—including extended high frequencies (EHF)—were measured using a diagnostic audiometer. The χ2 test determined the difference in auditory deficit prevalence between the study groups. Logistic regression was used to identify predictor variables associated with auditory deficits in the hypertensive group. Results: A hearing loss prevalence of 37.4% among hypertensive adults compared to 14.1% among the non-hypertensive group (P = 0.000, χ2 = 14.00) was found. The EHF pure-tone average among the hypertensive group was 44.1 ± 19.2 dB HL, and 20.0 ± 18.3 dB HL among the control group. Bilateral mild sensorineural hearing loss was the most common type of hearing loss among hypertensive adults. A higher prevalence of tinnitus (41.5%) was found in the hypertensive group compared to the control group (22.8%) (P = 0.008, χ2 = 7.09). In this study, 30.3% of hypertensive adults had tinnitus without hearing loss compared to 17.7% non-hypertensive adults. Factors associated with hearing loss included being between 50 and 55 years [adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 3.35; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.32–8.50; P = 0.011], having grade 2 hypertension (AOR = 4.18; 95% CI: 1.02–17.10; P = 0.048), and being on antihypertensive medication (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI: 1.02–9.87; P = 0.045). Tinnitus was associated with grade 3 hypertension (AOR = 3.90; 95% CI: 1.12–12.64; P = 0.033).

			"Background: Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) is the most widespread sensory disorder in the elderly. Poor audiological support within retirement homes is one of the fundamental issues impacting the Quality of Life (QoL). Objectives: The objectives of this study were to: (1) Identify the presence of hearing impairment through a hearing screening test battery in a sample of elderly participants residing in three retirement homes. (2) Determine the psychological, communication-related and social impact of the hearing impairment on the QoL in a sample of elderly participants residing in retirement homes. Method: A prospective cross-sectional research design with quantitative methods of data analysis was used to obtain data from 70 elderly participants (mean age = 79 years, 79% were female). Ten of them used hearing aids. Hearing screening was conducted using otoscopy, tympanometry and air conduction screening (500 Hz–4 kHz). The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQoL) questionnaire was adapted and utilised for the present study. Results: Findings revealed that 77% of the sample obtained a refer result from the hearing screening protocol indicating a high presence of hearing impairment. Twenty-nine per cent (n = 16) of the participants felt depressed, worried and anxious because of their hearing loss and 20% of participants felt unaccepted by their significant others as a result of their hearing impairment. Hearing difficulties were significantly associated with a reduced QoL (p = 0.045). Eight of the 10 participants who wore hearing aids reported an overall improvement in QoL since receiving and utilising their hearing aids and 20% (n = 2) of hearing aid users reported challenges with maintaining their hearing aids.",

			"Objective and design: This retrospective cohort study aimed to describe the differential effect of noise exposure and age-related hearing loss in a large sample of gold miners in South Africa. Study sample: Audiological data of 40 123 South African mine workers were investigated. Data of a non-noise-exposed control group (n = 6162) and group exposed to underground noise (≥ 85 dB A (TWA) (n = 33 961) were included. Within these two larger noise-exposed groups two homogenous exposure groups (HEG) were also selected for analyses, namely the driller group (n = 4399) and the administration group (administrative workers) (n = 2211). Participants were categorized in terms of noise exposure, age, and race. Results: Significantly different thresholds (worse for underground noise group) with respect to the median for all frequencies after adjusting for age was evident between the noise-exposed and control groups (ANCOVA). The largest differences in hearing thresholds between the noise-exposed and control groups were observed at 3 and 4 kHz in the age group 36 to 45 years. Administration and driller group differed significantly (driller group worse results) with respect to the mean LFA512 and HFA346 after adjusting for age (ANCOVA). Black males had significantly better high-frequency hearing compared with white male counterparts but significantly worse low-frequency hearing. Conclusion: Age was the most important influence on hearing thresholds for the noise and control groups. Race was shown to be a very significant factor determining susceptibility to NIHL and ARHL.",

			"Noise-induced hearing loss is 100% preventable if the collaborative stakeholders in the prevention process are fully committed to the process and implement effective measures timely. Audiologists have within their scope of practice the prevention of hearing loss and this needs to be at the forefront of all advocacy campaigns to prevent occupational hearing loss (OHL). In a systematic review by Moroe, Khoza-Shangase, Kanji and Ntlhakana (2018), where literature into the exposure to occupational noise in developing countries suggested that the prevalence of occupational noise-induced hearing loss (ONIHL) is still high, significant gaps in locally relevant and responsive evidence were identified. There is also evidence that the mining industry is aware of this epidemic; however, the efforts to curb ONIHL are currently unsuccessful. These authors explored and documented current evidence reflecting trends in the management of ONIHL in the mining industry in Africa from 1994 to 2016 through the use of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. Findings from this systematic review indicated that there is a dearth of research on the management of ONIHL in Africa. The limited research on the management of ONIHL focuses on some aspects of the hearing conservation programme pillars and not on all the pillars as suggested by some scholars in the field. Furthermore, they found that published studies had small sample sizes, thereby minimising their generalisation. This systematic review’s findings highlighted a need for more studies on the management of ONIHL in the mining sector, as evidence suggests that this condition in African countries is still on the rise; hence, there is the importance of this Special Issue, based on South Africa.",

			"More than 80% of people with hearing loss (HL) live in low- and middle-income countries. Up to 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents, leading to novel parenting, communication, educational, and psychosocial experiences. Half of congenital pre-lingual HL is genetic, with a relatively high recurrence risk that may lead to specific challenges for parents of affected children. Currently, little is known of genes implicated and causative mutations for most populations who have HL in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as genetic counseling services needs for this population. Therefore, this study aimed to explore parents’ perceptions and understanding of the genetic etiology of their child’s HL, in order to inform policies and services. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 parents of children who have non-syndromic HL of putative genetic origin. Data were analyzed through the framework approach. Three salient themes emerged, namely comprehension and understanding of the cause, in which most parents were unable to identify the potential hereditary cause of their child’s HL; responsibility and blame; and their perception of genetic counseling and testing. Most of the participants had positive attitudes towards genetic testing, describing that it may provide answers and that the information gained would be helpful for the future. The data could assist in understanding the challenges faced by parents, in the absence of genetic testing, emphasizing the need for accurate genetic testing to support counseling services to parents of children with HL in an African Setting.",

			"Background: Hearing loss in adults is one of the leading disabilities globally. It is managed through aural rehabilitation for which there is a paucity of literature in South Africa. This raises the question of interest, the integrity of holistic service provision amongst audiologists and whether interest and challenges affect current practices. Objectives: To describe audiologists’ practices and views on aural rehabilitation services for adults, including interest and challenges experienced. Method: A descriptive online survey was completed by 45 of 1440 invited practicing audiologists who were members of the two national professional associations in South Africa. Each association emailed the questionnaire link to all its members. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21, and included the paired samples t-test and chi-squared tests. Results: The most provided services were hearing aids (81.4%), communication strategies training (69.8%) and informational counselling (79.8%). A strong interest was reported by most for each service. Challenges included limited client compliance, unaffordability of services, limited undergraduate training, language barriers, unrealistic expectations and individual differences. Statistically significant differences between service provision, interest and challenges indicated that these are influential but not individually significant to service provision. Conclusion: Imbalanced service provision, high interest and many more challenges are experienced. These factors contribute but are not solely markedly influential in service provision.",

			"Background: Recreational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an increasing public health concern among young adults who frequently use personal listening devices (PLDs) at high volumes for extended periods. Despite this, awareness of NIHL risks remains low, particularly among university students in South Africa. Objective: This study aimed to assess undergraduate students’ awareness of recreational NIHL, examining their earphone use habits, volume preferences, preventive behaviors, and associations between demographic variables and NIHL awareness. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 154 undergraduate students at a large urban South African university. Quantitative data on listening habits, NIHL awareness, and preventive behaviors were collected and analysed using descriptive including thematic analysis and inferential statistics such as Chi-square tests to examine associations between variables. Results: Most participants (67.5%) reported daily earphone use, often at moderate (48.1%) or high (33.8%) volumes. Awareness of NIHL was low, with only 9.7% of students feeling very informed. Inferential analysis revealed significant associations between NIHL awareness and age (χ2 = 12.67, p < 0.05), as well as year of study (χ2 = 10.89, p < 0.05), with older students and those in upper academic years (third year or beyond) showing greater awareness. Preventive behaviors were inconsistent; 46.1% of students reported lowering volume, while 13.0% took no preventive measures. Further analysis revealed that students who preferred high volumes were more likely to adopt preventive measures, while those who preferred low volumes often took no action, perceiving their existing habits as safe. Thematic analysis identified concerns about hearing health, barriers to safe listening, influence of social norms, and misconceptions about ear health. Conclusion: The findings highlight a high prevalence of potentially unsafe listening behaviors and low NIHL awareness among South African university students. Recommendations include university-based hearing health programs, leveraging social media for outreach, integrating education into first-year curricula, and promoting affordable protective options, and social media campaigns targeting safe listening practices. These measures could help foster safer listening habits and reduce NIHL risk within this vulnerable population.",

			"Students who are hard of hearing (HOH) are being granted access to university increasingly, yet they remain significantly under-represented and under-supported, often resulting in poor academic outcomes with elevated levels of attrition. This situation places a growing obligation on universities to improve the support provided to these students in order to have a positive influence on their overall academic experience and eventual economic independence. This trend is relevant to South Africa, where Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are accepting and registering students with a hearing loss but are not providing adequate academic support and inclusive curricula. Furthermore, in South Africa, almost no research has been conducted concerning students who are HOH in higher education regarding their teaching and learning needs or the coping strategies which they use to survive academically. However, what is known is that, of those HOH students who do enter higher education, many do not graduate successfully (up to 75%) and, of those that do graduate, manycontinuetobeexcludedfromprofessions.Theaimsofthisarticleweretoreportontheteachingandlearningexperiences of students who are HOH at a South African university, who prefer to make use of spoken language, to share the daily barriers with which they are faced, and to provide recommendations for teaching and learning, as well as curricula transformation.

		abstract:
			"Background: A growing number of students with hearing loss are being granted access to higher education in South Africa due to the adoption of inclusive educational policies. However, available statistics indicate that participation by students with hearing impairments in higher education remains low and research suggests that support provisioning for those who do gain access is inadequate. Objectives:  This article aims to illustrate that the assumed self-identity of students with hearing impairment influences their choice to disclose their disability. The choice not to disclose their hearing loss prevents them from accessing the necessary reasonable accommodations and this in turn may affect their eventual educational success. Method: Reported here is a qualitative descriptive case study at a South African university. Purposive sampling methods were employed. Data were gathered from in-depth interviews with seven students with hearing impairment ranging from moderate to profound, using spoken language. Constructivist grounded theory was used as an approach to the process of generating and transforming the data, as well as the construction of theory. Findings: All the student participants identified as having a hearing rather than a D/deaf identity cultural paradigm and viewed themselves as ‘normal’. Linked to this was their unwillingness to disclose their hearing impairment and thus access support. Conclusion: It is crucially important for academic, support and administrative staff to be aware of both the assumed ‘hearing’ identity and therefore subsequent non-disclosure practices of students with a hearing impairment using the oral method of communication. Universities need to put measures in place to encourage students to voluntarily disclose their hearing impairment in order to provide more targeted teaching and learning support. This could lead to improved educational outcomes for students.",

			"The purpose of the current study was to explore the challenges experienced by hearing parents when parenting a child with hearing loss. Using a qualitative purposive sampling design, interviews were conducted with 13 parents (9 mothers, 4 fathers) residing in Cape Town, South Africa. Four salient themes emerged, namely: 1) communication is difficult, hard, and frustrating; 2) lack of knowledge and information about hearing loss makes it difficult to parent; 3) little or no support makes for a lonely journey; and 4) support identified by parents for parents. The findings of the study have important implications for collaboration and partnerships between parents and health and family practitioners within South Africa for the design and development of supportive interventions for parents parenting a child with hearing loss.",

			"Objective: To systematically assess the data on the prevalence and causes of hearing impairment in Africa. Methods: Systematic review on the prevalence and causes of hearing loss in Africa. We undertook a literature search of seven electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Medline, Global Health, Web of Knowledge, Academic Search Complete and Africa Wide Information) and manually searched bibliographies of included articles. The search was restricted to population-based studies on hearing impairment in Africa. Data were extracted using a standard protocol. Results: We identified 232 articles and included 28 articles in the final analysis. The most common cut-offs used for hearing impairment were 25 and 30 dB HL, but this ranged between 15 and 40 dB HL. For a cut-off of 25 dB, the median was 7.7% for the children- or school-based studies and 17% for population-based studies. For a cut-off of 30 dB HL, the median was 6.6% for the children or school-based studies and 31% for population-based studies. In schools for the deaf, the most common cause of hearing impairment was cryptogenic deafness (50%) followed by infectious causes (43%). In mainstream schools and general population, the most common cause of hearing impairment was middle ear disease (36%), followed by undetermined causes (35%) and cerumen impaction (24%). Conclusion: There are very few population-based studies available to estimate the prevalence of hearing impairment in Africa. Those studies that are available use different cut-offs, making comparison difficult. However, the evidence suggests that the prevalence of hearing impairment is high and that much of it is avoidable or treatable.",
